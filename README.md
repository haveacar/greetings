# greetings
<p><strong>Time greetings in different languages</strong></p>
<p>I am a student created a small program for homework.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>After the user enters his name, the program checks &nbsp;first letter of his name by Unicode.</p>
<p>after that &nbsp;know the language of the user in which he speaks</p>
<p>After the user receives greetings in his language.</p>
<p>Depending on the time of day: e.g. good morning, good evening, &nbsp;good night..</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>Greeting is available in English, Ukrainian, Hebrew but can be in any language.</p>
<p>Maybe possible to make the code simpler I will be glad to advice:)</p>
